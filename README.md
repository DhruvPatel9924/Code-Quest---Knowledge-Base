Here are the setup instructions to clone  repository from GitHub and set it up:

Step-by-Step Setup Instructions:


Clone the GitHub Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
code:
git clone https://github.com/DhruvPatel9924/Code-Quest---Knowledge-Base.git

Navigate to the Project Directory: After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:
bash
code:

cd AlmashinesProject

Install Dependencies: Once inside the project directory, run the following command to install all necessary packages and dependencies from package.json:
bash
code:

npm install

Rename .env.example to .env: You need to copy or rename the .env.example file to .env:
bash
code:

mv .env.example .env

After renaming, open the .env file and fill in the required environment variables.

Set Up MongoDB:
Step 1: Install MongoDB (if not installed): If you haven't installed MongoDB yet, follow the MongoDB Installation Guide for your operating system.
Step 2: Start MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB is running. You can do this by running:
bash
code:

mongod

Alternatively, if you are using a MongoDB cloud solution like MongoDB Atlas, ensure you have the connection string ready.
Step 3: Update the .env File: Inside the .env file, add your MongoDB connection string. For example:
bash
code:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name

If you are using MongoDB Atlas, the connection string will look something like:
bash
code:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Start the Application: After setting up the environment variables, you can start the application by running:
bash
code:

npm start

Access the Application: After starting the application, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port in your project) to view it.
